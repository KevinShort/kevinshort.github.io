		Hello.  Thank you for visiting my corner of the web.  
		My name is Christine.  I am the mother of two mostly 
		grown boys and wife to my high school sweetheart.  
		I was inspired to start crocheting by watching my 
		grandmother crochet while I was a child.  Although I 
		had dabbled in crocheting I had not done it in a while 
		due to my children’s active lifestyles.  I was 
		diagnosed with breast cancer early in 2012.  Sitting 
		on the couch and watching TV when I was not feeling 
		well just wasn’t cutting it for me so I decided to 
		start crocheting again.  Well, once I started I just 
		couldn’t stop, so here I am, selling my wares on the 
		internet.  Please make yourself comfortable and take 
		a look around.  Thank you for visiting Chris’ Crochet Corner.
		</p>
